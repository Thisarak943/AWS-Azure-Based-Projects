AWS-Based DevOps Projects
-------------------------

This repository contains a collection of real-world projects based on Amazon Web Services (AWS), combined with containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and essential DevOps tools. These projects demonstrate how cloud infrastructure and automation tools work together to build, deploy, and manage scalable applications in cloud environments.

Each project includes configuration files, infrastructure setup guides, and step-by-step instructions for deployment and operations.

Project Highlights:
- Deploying Dockerized applications to AWS EC2 and ECS
- Using EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for container orchestration
- Setting up automated CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and AWS CodePipeline
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and AWS CloudFormation
- Using AWS services like S3, RDS, IAM, CloudWatch, and Route 53
- Monitoring and alerting using CloudWatch, Prometheus, and Grafana
- Secure configuration and secret management using AWS Secrets Manager and Parameter Store

What I Learned:
- How to provision and manage AWS resources using the AWS Console and CLI
- Building infrastructure using Terraform with reusable and versioned modules
- Managing EC2 instances, security groups, VPCs, and IAM roles
- Deploying scalable containerized workloads using ECS and EKS
- Creating CI/CD pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment stages
- Integrating Docker and Kubernetes environments with AWS
- Implementing best practices for security, cost optimization, and monitoring in cloud environments

Tools & Technologies Used:
- AWS: EC2, S3, EKS, ECS, RDS, IAM, CloudWatch, Secrets Manager, CodePipeline, Route 53
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Helm, Prometheus, Grafana
- OS & Infra: Linux (Ubuntu,RHEL), Nginx, Git, Bash

This repository showcases my hands-on experience with modern cloud-native DevOps workflows using AWS. It is intended as a learning reference and a demonstration of practical skills for DevOps and Cloud Engineering roles.
